This is a cow-themed version of Connect Four that allows for two-player gameplay. Vanilla JavaScript is utilized
on the frontend to facilitate game logic, respond to user actions, and determine game outcomes. The backend is a RESTful API 
built with Ruby on Rails. The application is styled with custom CSS.

To run the backend of this application, cd into the connect-4-api directory before creating the database, running the migrations, and starting the rails server. 
The frontend can be run from the main directory, with an 'open index.html' command in the terminal.
